        <p>Hi! I'm Chris, a second-year computer science student at KU! I'm also in the STEMTeack program to study to be a STEM educator.</p>
        <p>My main interest within CS is artificial intelligence; I'm in the AI club, and my group is working to make a transformer model
           that takes in a programming problem statement and produces Python code to solve the problem. I'm currently working on implementing
           a transformer in Java based on Google's Attention is All You Need. </p>
        <p>Java is my preferred programming language because it is the language with which I have the most experience. I started programming
           in middle school when I made a mod for Minecraft in Java. Additionally, in high school, I was on the First Tech Challenge team my
           senior year, where I used Java to program our robot for autonomous operation. Our team went on to compete at the state-level
           tornament for Kansas and Missouri, where we achieved the first-place Control Award. This was a very proud moment for me, because
           the Control Award is based mainly on the robot's autonomous operation.</p>
        <p>In addition to Java, I know C, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
